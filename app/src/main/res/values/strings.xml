        for those methods that are marked as being killable,
        after that method returns the process hosting the activity may be
        killed by the system at any time without another line of its code being executed.
        Because of this, you should use the onPause() method to write any persistent
        data (such as user edits) to storage. In addition, the method
        onSaveInstanceState(android.os.Bundle) is called before placing the activity
        in such a background state, allowing you to save away any dynamic instance state
        in your activity into the given Bundle, to be later received in onCreate(Bundle)
        if the activity needs to be re-created. See the Process Lifecycle section for
        more information on how the lifecycle of a process is tied to the activities it is hosting.
        Note that it is important to save persistent data in onPause() instead of
        onSaveInstanceState(Bundle) because the latter is not part of the lifecycle callbacks,
        so will not be called in every situation as described in its documentation.
        For those methods that are not marked as being killable, the activity s process will
        not be killed by the system starting from the time the method is called and continuing
        after it returns. Thus an activity is in the killable state, for example, between after
        onStop() to the start of onResume(). Keep in mind that under extreme memory pressure the
        system can kill the application process at any time.</string>
